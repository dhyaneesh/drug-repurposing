# Drug Repurposing with GraphRAG

## Overview
This project addresses a critical challenge in drug discovery: repurposing known drugs effectively. Traditional drug development is costly and time-consuming, making drug repurposing a promising alternative. By leveraging **Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG)**, this project aims to enhance AI-driven insights for drug repurposing, improving explainability and decision-making.

## Features
- Utilizes **GraphRAG** for knowledge retrieval and generation.
- Integrates biomedical knowledge graphs to improve drug repurposing insights.
- Enhances explainability in AI-driven predictions for drug repurposing.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API Key

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhyaneesh/drug-repurposing.git
   cd drug-repurposing
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
